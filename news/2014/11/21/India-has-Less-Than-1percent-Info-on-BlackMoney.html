<h1>India has Less Than 1% Info on Black Money, Lots More I Can Offer</h1>

<p>Herve Falciani is the whistle-blower who had carried out one of the
biggest security breaches in Swiss banking history,obtaining details of some 127,000 accounts worth 180 billion euros which also contained the list of over 600 names which was recently shared by Central govt. with Supreme court.</p>

<p>In an interview with NDTV,Falciani said that in 2011 France has shared the list of Indians who allegedly hold bank accounts at HSBC with the government which is </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;just the tip of the iceberg&quot; and also added the fact that India was given only 2 MB of the 200 GB of data and so they have less than 1 percent of the information from the original data.</p>

<p>He is now helping investigators from several countries trying to fight large scale tax evasion, money laundering and corruption.Among these countries are US, France, Spain and Belgium.He is keen to help India and has said, &quot;If India asks tomorrow we will send a proposal tomorrow&quot;.</p>

<p>The whistle-blower also told NDTV that there is &quot;1000 times more information&quot; available for investigators and there are a lot of business procedures to be unveiled to them. &quot;It&#39;s just up to (the Indian administration). They can contact us,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>This week, PM Narendra Modi made an appreciable pitch at the G20 Summit in for &quot;close coordination&quot; among nations and transparency in efforts to retrieve black money. The Logical Indian is of the opinion that the government should take cognisance of above-said by Mr Falciani and should act immediately to carry out the necessary process to bring back the #BlackMoney as promised.</p>
