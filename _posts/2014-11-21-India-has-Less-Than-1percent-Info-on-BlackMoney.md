>"just the tip of the iceberg" and also added the fact that India was given only 2 MB of the 200 GB of data and so they have less than 1 percent of the information from the original data.

He is now helping investigators from several countries trying to fight large scale tax evasion, money laundering and corruption.Among these countries are US, France, Spain and Belgium.He is keen to help India and has said, "If India asks tomorrow we will send a proposal tomorrow".
